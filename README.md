SOCIAL ENGINEERING & PHISHING SIMULATION

In this project, I simulated phishing attacks to assess employee awareness and identify gaps in our security practices. I used tools like Gophish and the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) to carry out the simulations. The outcome was a detailed report analyzing the success rates of the campaign and providing recommendations to enhance employee security training.
